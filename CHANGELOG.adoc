== 2.3.3 (2024-12-12)
* Memory optimizations when creating nodes from parser.
* Remove unnecessary skip term thus bit simplifying generated parser.
* Include invalid operator symbol in exception message.

== 2.3.2 (2024-05-01)
* Avoid unnecessary copying ComparisonNode or it's arguments.

== 2.3.1 (2024-05-01)
* `ComparisonNode::toString` throws NPE when argument list is empty.

== 2.3.0 (2024-05-01)
* Support for operators without arguments `=null=`, `=notnull=`.
* Allow `=in=` and `=out=` operators to have no arguments.
* Optimize memory footprint of argument list creation when there's only one argument.

== 2.2.1 (2023-11-18)
* Update JavaCC to 7.0.13 version.

== 2.2.0 (2023-11-11)
* Allow quoted selectors with reserved characters. https://github.com/sdeming[@sdeming]
* NodesFactory will throw exception if operator alternative symbols are overlapping.
* More optimize for unescape and unquote by using bulk ops.
* Overload RSQLParser constructor to accept NodesFactory.

== 2.1.2 (2023-06-23)
* Update JavaCC to 7.0.12 version.
* Optimize unescape performance
* Optimize memory footprint by using Reader as a Parser source

== 2.1.1 (2023-06-23)
* Change artifact Maven coordinates from `cz.jirutka.rsql:rsql-parser` to `io.github.nstdio:rsql-parser`

== 2.1.0 (2014-02-07)

* Added `\` (backslash) as an escape character inside a quoted argument (requested in {issue-uri}/#7[#7]).

== 2.0.0 (2014-10-23)

* Simplified AST; node per operator replaced with just ComparisonNode.
* Simplified support for custom operators; the RSQLNodesFactory is no longer needed.
* The RSQLParserException changed to inherit from the RuntimeException.
* Added withSelector/withArguments/withChildren methods to the AST nodes.
* Tests improved.

== 2.0.M1 (2014-03-20)

* JavaCC grammar, all the code and tests completely rewritten.
* Proper AST with enhanced Visitor pattern implemented.
* Introduced support for enhancing parser with custom FIQL-like operators.

* Added `=in=` and `=out=` operators, arguments group.
* FIQL operators syntax relaxed; any `=[a-z]*=` is parsed as an operator and validation is done in RSQLNodesFactory.
  This allows to add custom operators.
* Selector syntax relaxed, it can contain any non-reserved characters now.
* Dropped an alternative notation for equal operator; only pair equal characters (`==`) are allowed!

== 1.0.2 (2014-01-12)

* Setup testing on Travis.
* Released in Maven Central.

== 1.0.1 (2013-03-25)

* Moved to CVUT Maven repository.
* Relicensed under MIT License.

== 1.0 (2011-08-29)

The first public release.
